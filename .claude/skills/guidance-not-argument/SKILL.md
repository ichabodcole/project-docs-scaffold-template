description:
  Separate what a reader acts on from the story of how the project came to
  believe it, in a document that has accumulated both. Use on a long guidance
  page, standard, README or skill that has grown case studies, measurements,
  attributions and revision notes. Use whenever someone says a document is too
  long, dense, repetitive or hard to act on, or asks to "tighten this page",
  "cut the fluff", "make this more concise", "trim the evidence" or "clean up
  the docs" — and before publishing a long-lived guidance document anywhere new,
  since relocating a page is when its accumulated history becomes most visible.

# Separate the guidance from the argument for it

A document that is edited over months accumulates the record of its own editing:
the trial that produced a recommendation, the adopter who found the defect, the
figure that settled an argument, the sentence a previous draft got wrong. Each
addition was correct when it landed. Together they bury the thing the reader
came for.

**The document is the declaration, not the argument for the declaration.** Its
reader spends attention on every line, and a line that does not change what they
build cost them something for nothing. The surveys, trials and adopter findings
stay in the reports and research notes, linked for anyone who wants them. They
are the about page, not the product.

**Length is not the measure.** Report the counts because they are cheap to
check, but a removal earns its place by making the page clearer or truer. A
replacement that runs as long as what it replaced is fine when the reason needed
the room. A pass optimising the counter starts cutting reasons.

## The pass

Work in chunks a reader would recognise — one section, not a paragraph and not
the whole document.

1. **Read the chunk whole** before proposing anything.
2. **Classify every passage** against the table below, and write the list down.
   The written list is what makes a review checkable by anyone else, and it is
   what makes you actually look: sections given a candidate list yield findings,
   sections given a sentence yield them later to whoever asks.
3. **Put the list in front of whoever owns the document** before editing.
   Disagreement is cheap here and expensive afterwards, and the owner will
   overrule some of it — that is the point.
4. **Apply the agreed removals one at a time**, asserting after each that the
   removed text is gone. A replacement helper that inserts without removing
   produces a duplicated paragraph, and no gate reports it.
5. **Read the whole chunk again**, not the diff. The diff shows what changed;
   only the chunk shows what stopped making sense.
6. **Verify**, using the list below.
7. **Record what came out**, verbatim.

## The test, and the four answers

For every passage: **would a reader who skipped this do anything differently?**

| classification    | what it means                                 | what to do                        |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| **scope**         | a definition of what the document covers      | keep; it needs no evidence at all |
| **reason stated** | the justification survives without the story  | keep the reason, cut the story    |
| **evidence only** | a measurement or case with no reason to state | compress to a citation            |
| **no reason**     | the narrative _was_ the justification         | record it; do not invent one      |

**Ask "scope" first.** A statement of what the document is about is not a claim
about the world, and no census makes it true or false.

**The fourth answer is the valuable one.** When the reason will not come out,
either it exists and has never been articulated, or what is there is a
coincidence being treated as a reason. Say which. Never write a sentence into
the reason's slot to fill it — a required slot is not evidence.

## What earns its place

- **The recommendation.** What to do.
- **The mechanism.** Why it is right, stated so it holds for cases nobody has
  run. A mechanism covers every instance; a story covers the one it happened to.
- **One citation** for any measured claim — named and linked, not retold.
- **An example that teaches a term.**
  `Unknown option '--nope'. Valid flags: --format` shows what "names the valid
  set" means. That is part of the instruction. An example showing a claim held
  once is not.
- **Confidence and coverage marks**, and any sentence marking the document's own
  certainty down.
- **Honest limits** — what the thing cannot do, stated plainly.

## Shapes that recur

- **The attribution tell.** The sharpest sentence in a section is the one inside
  quotation marks. Where a page cites a source for its best line, check whether
  the line is actually the page's own position — and lift it if it is.
  Attribution is often a substitute for asserting.
- **A quotation that needs fencing.** When a passage is followed by
  qualifications of its own quotation, the qualifications are not the problem.
  Quoting commits you to defending someone's exact words including the parts you
  do not mean; state the position yourself and there is nothing to walk back.
- **Revision records.** _"until this revision"_, _"that objection won"_, _"an
  earlier version said"_. A document keeping a changelog in its body, addressed
  to a reader who never saw the draft.
- **A claim stated twice with material between the copies.** The material stops
  you noticing the copies. Removing it is what makes the duplication visible —
  so re-read the two paragraphs that were adjacent to anything you cut.
- **An inventory.** Decoration when it repeats a claim one case already makes;
  the argument when the claim is about a population — you cannot establish an
  absence with one example. Establishing a population takes a few members, not
  all of them.
- **A phrase reused as punctuation.** A vivid example that turns up wherever the
  document wants emphasis. Load-bearing once, decoration after.
- **The project narrating its own conduct** — why a section is placed here, that
  a case is recorded rather than hidden, that something is stated loudly.
- **Self-assessment inside guidance.** A claim about what this project can and
  cannot establish belongs where the project is argued for. The guidance says
  what to build.
- **A case with no rule.** Sometimes the general form does not exist anywhere in
  the passage, and the cut is an extraction rather than a compression. You
  cannot tell which until you try to write the rule.
- **A stated policy the document breaks.** Where a page states a rule about
  itself, check the page against it. A stated policy is a test the document
  already wrote and left unrun.
- **A trailing clause that calibrates instead of stating a consequence.** A
  clause saying what happens earns its place: the tree stays runnable, the
  commit goes missing, the step is a detector rather than a remedy. One saying
  how true, how frequent or how important the preceding claim is does not — that
  is a measurement, and it needs one. Watch for it where a bare instruction
  feels abrupt and the clause supplies cadence: it arrives feeling like
  finishing a sentence rather than adding a claim. **Test by promotion** — stand
  it alone as its own sentence and see whether it still says anything.

## Duplication

Not all of it is a defect. **Duplicate a reason** where two documents both need
a reader to have it; rewriting a strong sentence into a weaker paraphrase purely
to avoid saying it twice is a bad trade. **Do not duplicate evidence** — that is
what a link is for, and it is where copies drift.

**If a passage earns duplication, duplicate it verbatim.** A recognisable copy
is its own weak signal: an editor changing one will notice the other exists. A
paraphrase is the worst of both worlds — a second copy that does not look like
one, and the form in which copies silently diverge.

## What this method breaks

Compression is the operation that creates dangling references. Removing the
sentence that introduced something, while keeping the sentence that refers to
it, is not carelessness — it is the default outcome. Expect all of these, and
note that **no linter, formatter or test suite sees any of them**: a stale
pointer resolves, a dangling antecedent parses, an orphaned pronoun reads as
competent prose.

- **Antecedents.** A pronoun, a definite article, "the same X", "both", "that
  page".
- **References across sections and documents.** A figure cut in one section is
  cited in another; a term introduced once is used a hundred lines later. Two
  instances crossed Part boundaries.
- **Conventions.** Removing the passages that carried a marking convention can
  leave the convention declared and unused. A rule left standing with nothing
  obeying it is the same class as a stale pointer, inverted.
- **Cross-references describing a section's character.** A sentence saying what
  another section is goes stale when that section changes, and its bytes never
  move.
- **Links, broken badly enough to stop being links.** Text inserted between a
  label and its URL leaves neither, and a link checker looking for `](` no
  longer sees it at all.
- **Quantifiers the compression manufactures.** Everything above is something
  the method destroys. This is something it asserts. Turning a set of cases into
  one sentence produces a count or a scope — _the four sentences_, _which of
  three things_, _never_, _nowhere else_, _nothing else_ — that nobody
  enumerated, because enumerating means finding the exceptions and the
  exceptions are what the summary exists to omit. Measured across one change
  set: nine of ten false statements were spanning claims, and each sat exactly
  on top of a threshold or an exclusion. Sentences about a single instantiated
  case were almost all true.
- **Reasons, which are inferences and not observations.** A _because_ clause
  explains why the system does something, and it can follow perfectly from the
  design while being false about the code. One repair replaced a true sentence
  with a false one this way, reasoning that a serious violation must reject the
  whole input when it in fact drops one record.

## Verifying

**Read the whole section after editing it.** This is the only instrument that
finds the failures above. Searches confirm what you already know to name; they
cannot report that a sentence no longer makes sense. Every stale reference this
method produced was invisible to a full repository gate, and several were
invisible to greps written specifically to catch them.

Then, in order of what has actually caught things:

1. **Before cutting on the grounds that a passage lives elsewhere, verify that
   it lives elsewhere.** "It belongs in X" is a rule about where things should
   live, not evidence about where this one is.
2. **Search the whole document for every term, figure or actor a cut removed.**
   Not the section — the document.
3. **Read each sentence against the thing it describes, not just the section it
   sits in.** These are two instruments and they catch different defects:
   reading the whole section finds the dangling antecedent and the stale count;
   only holding a sentence beside the code, output or data it is about finds the
   one that asserts more than its subject establishes. A document can survive
   the first and fail the second, and the failures are fluent.
4. **Treat every quantifier as a claim that has to be run.** A number, a
   threshold, a key name, an _only_, a _never_, an _always_, a definite article
   standing for a closed set. Produce the case first and write the sentence over
   it; composing the sentence and then an example to fit it is how two
   separately true halves become one impossible whole. Where the run cannot be
   made, delete the sentence rather than hedge it — a missing sentence is
   honest, an unverified one is the defect.
5. **Re-read what points at the section, and what it pointed to.** Including a
   document's own policies about itself.
6. **Check every id and label you write.** An id is a label, and labels are not
   checked by anything: a link to a real file with an invented finding id passes
   every gate.
7. **Look at over-long lines.** Where the formatter preserves author line
   breaks, a line running past the document's usual width marks a passage edited
   without being reread. It finds no defect by itself and it aims a read very
   well.
8. **Run the repository gate**, last, knowing it cannot see the interesting
   failures.

**Get a cold reader for anything substantial.** The agent who made the edits is
the worst reader of them: they hold the context the sentence no longer supplies.

## Record what came out

Keep one file holding every removed passage verbatim, with its original line
numbers and its classification. It makes the pass reversible by reading one
document, lets the second pass judge the whole set at once, and is the only way
anyone can check what a section's review actually considered.

**Declaring a section clean without listing what was considered leaves no record
anyone can check — including you.** Sections given a written candidate list
yielded findings on review; sections given a sentence yielded more the moment
somebody asked.

Some removals carry content that exists nowhere else — usually guidance for
whoever maintains the document rather than for its reader, such as when a
notation may grow a new category. That belongs in a decision page, not in the
guidance and not lost.
