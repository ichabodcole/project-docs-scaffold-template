USAGE: Copy this file to docs/briefs/ as `YYYY-MM-DD-<name>.md`.

A brief captures the identity of an idea before any implementation decisions
are made. It's the output of a workshop session — a focused conversation that
develops a rough spark into something concrete enough to act on.

Briefs predate projects. A brief might spawn multiple projects, a single
investigation, a manifesto, or simply sit as a captured idea to revisit later.
