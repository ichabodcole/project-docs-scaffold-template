# Added Design Resolution document type

**Date:** 2026-02-13

Added an optional "Design Resolution" stage between Proposal and Plan in the
documentation pipeline. Includes a template, interactive Q&A skill, slash
command, and documentation updates across 15+ files. Also updated
`proposal-to-plan` to read `design-resolution.md` when present, and cleaned up
`marketplace.json` to remove duplicated metadata.

**Key files:** `docs/projects/TEMPLATES/DESIGN-RESOLUTION.template.md`,
`plugins/project-docs/skills/proposal-to-design-resolution/SKILL.md`,
`plugins/project-docs/commands/proposal-to-design-resolution.md`

**Docs:** [Project folder](../projects/design-resolution-doc-type/),
[Plugin README](../../plugins/project-docs/README.md)
