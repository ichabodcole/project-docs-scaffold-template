<!--
IMPORTANT: If you haven't read the README.md in this directory, please read it first for context on when to
create specifications and what to include.

USING THIS TEMPLATE:

The overview specification is the entry point to the specification set. It describes the application at a high
level — what it is, who it's for, and how the pieces fit together. Every specification set should have one.

This file should:
- Be understandable by someone with no knowledge of the codebase
- Contain no technology-specific references
- Link to all other specification files
- Define terminology used across the spec set
-->

# [Application Name] — Specification Overview

## What This Application Is

[2-3 paragraphs describing the application's purpose, who it's for, and what
problem it solves. Write as if explaining to someone who has never seen the
application.]

## Core Concepts

Define the key terms and entities used throughout the specification set. These
are the building blocks of the application's domain.

| Concept | Definition |
| ------- | ---------- |
|         |            |

## Key User Journeys

Describe the primary ways users interact with the application. Focus on the most
important flows.

### [Journey Name]

[Brief narrative description of what the user does and what the application does
in response.]

## Specification Index

List all specification files with a brief description of what each covers.

| File | Domain | Description |
| ---- | ------ | ----------- |
|      |        |             |

## Conventions

Document any conventions used across the specification set.

- **Time values:** Expressed in milliseconds with human-readable labels (e.g.,
  `300000 (5 minutes)`)
- **Nullable fields:** Marked as `type or null` in data model tables
- **Optional fields:** Marked as `type (optional)` — field may be omitted
  entirely
- **Pseudocode:** Generic syntax with descriptive variable names, no
  language-specific constructs

## Cross-Platform Considerations

[If the application targets or may target multiple platforms, note any
behavioral differences here. If single-platform, remove this section.]
