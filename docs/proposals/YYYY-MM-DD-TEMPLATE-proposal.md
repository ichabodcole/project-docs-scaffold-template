IMPORTANT: If you haven't read the README.md in this directory, please read it first for context on when to

USING THIS TEMPLATE:

This template helps you tell the story of what you're proposing and why. It's not a specification form.
Think of it as mapping out the major landmarks ("the capitals") without detailing every step along the way.

Adapt sections as needed. Merge, skip, or add sections based on what helps tell your story clearly.
Use prose and narrative flow - this is a story about where we're going, not a questionnaire to fill out.

Core questions to answer: What are we building? Why? What's the high-level approach? What's in/out of scope?

# [Proposal Title]

**Status:** Draft | Under Review | Approved | Rejected | Superseded **Created:**
YYYY-MM-DD **Author:** [Name]

---

## Overview

[1-2 paragraph summary of what this proposal is about and why it matters]

## Problem Statement

What problem are we solving? What's the pain point or opportunity? Who's
affected and why does this matter?

## Proposed Solution

What's the high-level approach? Describe the major components and how they fit
together.

How will users experience this? Include concrete examples, user stories, or
scenarios that illustrate the feature in action.

[If comparing alternatives is important, discuss them here - what options were
considered and why this approach was chosen]

## Scope

**In Scope (MVP):** What's included in the first iteration?

**Out of Scope:** What are we explicitly NOT doing (at least initially)?

**Future Considerations:** What might we add later?

## Technical Approach

High-level technical strategy - how does this fit into existing architecture?
What patterns, technologies, or major components are involved?

What are the key dependencies (existing features, systems, or external
libraries)?

[If data changes are significant: What new entities or relationships are needed?
Keep high-level - detailed schemas belong in implementation plans]

[Use illustrative examples or pseudocode if helpful, but avoid production-ready
code - that belongs in implementation plans]

## Impact & Risks

**Benefits:** What value does this provide?

**Risks:** What could go wrong? How will we mitigate?

**Complexity:** [Low/Medium/High] - Why?

## Open Questions (Optional)

[Anything still undecided or needing further discussion]

## Success Criteria (Optional)

[How will we know this succeeded? What are the measurable outcomes?]
