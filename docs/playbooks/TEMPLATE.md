<!--
IMPORTANT: If you haven't read the README.md in this directory, please read it first for context on when to
create playbooks and when NOT to create them.

USING THIS TEMPLATE:

Playbooks are reusable dev plans for augmenting existing systems or executing recurring tasks.
They should be generic enough to apply to multiple situations but specific enough to be actionable.

Focus on: When to use this, what the approach is, key steps/phases, common pitfalls, and validation.
Adapt sections as needed - some playbooks might need 2 phases, others might need 5.
