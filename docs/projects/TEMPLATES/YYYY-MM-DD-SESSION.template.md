<!--
USAGE: Copy this file to your project's `sessions/` folder, replacing YYYY-MM-DD with the current date
and renaming to describe the session topic (e.g., 2026-02-09-initial-implementation.md).

This is your dev journal - write what's relevant, skip what's not. Sessions are informal and flexible.
Focus on what stands out: deviations from plan, unexpected discoveries, lessons learned.

Sessions serve two audiences:
1. YOU (or future you) - reflecting on what happened, capturing context for later
2. THE NEXT DEVELOPER - if someone takes over your work, this provides breadcrumbs to understand where
   you left off, what issues you hit, and what went off-plan

If everything went smoothly and there's nothing notable, you might only need a few lines.
If you wrestled with a complex bug for hours, write as much as helps capture what happened.

For more guidance on sessions, see the projects README: ../../README.md

# [Topic] — YYYY-MM-DD

## Context

[What were you working on? Why? Link to related plan/proposal if applicable.]

## What Happened

[The journey - write naturally about what you did, what went smoothly, what
didn't.

This is the heart of the session. Describe deviations from plan, unexpected
complexity, bugs encountered, architectural discoveries, anything notable. Use
prose, bullets, whatever flows naturally.

Examples of what to capture:

- "Spent 3 hours debugging X, turned out the issue was Y in file Z"
- "Plan assumed we could reuse component A, but discovered B was incompatible"
- "Refactored X because the original approach had issue Y"
- "Tests revealed edge case Z that wasn't in the plan"]

## Notable Discoveries (Optional)

[Key insights, bugs found, patterns noticed, things that weren't expected.

This can overlap with "What Happened" - use your judgment about whether to
separate or combine.]

## Changes Made (Optional)

[Key files or components modified. Include rationale if it's interesting or
non-obvious.

You don't need to list every file touched - focus on significant changes or
anything that deviated from plan. Example: "Refactored src/foo/bar.ts to use
pattern X instead of Y because of issue Z"]

## Lessons Learned (Optional)

[What would you do differently next time? What tips would help similar work in
the future?

This is especially valuable for capturing solutions to tricky problems or
insights about the codebase.]

## Follow-up (Optional)

[Open questions, next steps, things to revisit, areas that might need
refactoring, etc.]
