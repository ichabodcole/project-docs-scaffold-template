# Project Documentation Scaffold Template

A [Cookiecutter](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter) template that
instantly generates a complete, standardized documentation structure for
software projects.

## Why Use This?

Instead of creating documentation folders ad-hoc or copy-pasting from old
projects, get a battle-tested, consistent structure in seconds. Perfect for
developers and teams who want organized, AI-assistant-friendly documentation
without building the structure from scratch each time.

**Key benefits:**

- Pre-organized folders with best practices built in
- AI-ready with CLAUDE.md context templates
- Works seamlessly with the project-docs Claude Code plugin
- Structured for effective AI-assisted development workflows

## What This Template Provides

This template creates a complete documentation structure for your project,
including:

- **Structured documentation folders** for investigations, sessions, plans,
  proposals, playbooks, architecture, lessons learned, and fragments
- **README files** in each folder explaining purpose and best practices
- **Template files** for quick-start document creation
- **CLAUDE.md** template with project context for AI assistants (in docs/)
- **AGENTS.md** guidance file for AI coding assistants
- **Project README** template with standard sections

## Claude Code Plugin

This template is designed to work with the **project-docs** Claude Code plugin,
which provides specialized commands for managing your documentation structure:

- `/project-docs:project-summary` - Generate comprehensive project state
  analysis
- `/project-docs:project-recipe` - Extract reusable project patterns
- `/project-docs:update-deps` - Automated dependency management
- `/project-docs:review-docs` - Documentation health checks
- `/project-docs:proposal-to-plan` - Convert proposals to implementation plans

**Installation:**

```bash
# Add this repository as a marketplace
/plugin marketplace add ichabodcole/project-docs-scaffold-template

# Install the project-docs plugin
/plugin install project-docs
```

See [plugins/project-docs/README.md](plugins/project-docs/README.md) for
detailed documentation on each command.

## Installation

First, ensure you have Cookiecutter installed:

```bash
pip install cookiecutter
```

## Usage

Generate a new project documentation structure:

```bash
cookiecutter gh:ichabodcole/project-docs-scaffold-template
```

You'll be prompted to provide:

- **project_name** - Human-readable project name (e.g., "My Awesome Project")
- **project_slug** - Directory/repo name (auto-generated from project_name)
- **project_description** - Brief description of the project
- **author_name** - Your name
- **year** - Current year (auto-filled)

### Example

```bash
$ cookiecutter gh:ichabodcole/project-docs-scaffold-template

project_name [My Project]: My Awesome Project
project_slug [my-awesome-project]:
project_description [A brief description of the project]: A revolutionary new app
author_name [Your Name]: Jane Doe
year [2025]:
```

This creates:

```
my-awesome-project/
├── docs/
│   ├── reports/README.md
│   ├── investigations/README.md
│   ├── sessions/README.md
│   ├── plans/README.md
│   ├── proposals/README.md
│   ├── playbooks/README.md
│   ├── architecture/README.md
│   ├── lessons-learned/README.md
│   ├── fragments/README.md
│   ├── specifications/README.md
│   ├── interaction-design/README.md
│   ├── README.md
│   ├── CLAUDE.md
│   ├── AGENTS.md
│   └── PROJECT_MANIFESTO.md
└── README.md
```

## Documentation Structure

### `/docs/reports`

Structured assessment and analysis reports that evaluate current state of code,
documentation, or systems. Reports are typically generated by automated
processes or AI agents and serve as discovery mechanisms that can trigger
investigations, proposals, or direct action.

### `/docs/investigations`

Research documents that explore questions before committing to proposals.
Investigations gather evidence, analyze options, and determine whether action is
warranted.

### `/docs/sessions`

Chronological records of focused work sessions. Use for tracking progress,
debugging, and resuming work.

### `/docs/plans`

Development plans that translate proposals into actionable roadmaps with phases
and acceptance criteria.

### `/docs/proposals`

Feature proposals and design ideas exploring the "why" and "what" before
implementation.

### `/docs/playbooks`

Reusable implementation guides for recurring patterns (migrations, integrations,
refactors).

### `/docs/architecture`

System design documentation, architectural decisions, and technical
specifications.

### `/docs/lessons-learned`

Specific problems encountered and their solutions, preserving hard-won
knowledge.

### `/docs/specifications`

Technology-agnostic specification documents that describe what the application
is, what it does, and how it behaves — organized by domain. Portable enough to
rebuild the application in any technology stack.

### `/docs/fragments`

Incomplete observations and "something doesn't feel right" moments captured
during development. Fragments are breadcrumbs for patterns and concerns that
don't warrant immediate investigation but might become important later.

## Customization

After generating your project:

1. **Update docs/CLAUDE.md** with project-specific details, commands, and
   conventions
2. **Customize README.md** with actual installation and development instructions
3. **Review docs/README.md** and subfolder READMEs - they're ready to use but
   can be adapted
4. **Install the project-docs plugin** to leverage documentation management
   commands

## Adding to Existing Projects

By default, Cookiecutter will **not overwrite** existing directories. If you try
to generate a project in a location that already exists, you'll get an error.

**Options:**

1. **Generate with a different name** - Use a different `project_slug` value
2. **Generate in a temp location and copy** - Generate the template elsewhere,
   then manually copy only the files/folders you need into your existing project
3. **Use `--overwrite-if-exists` flag** - Explicitly allow overwriting
   (Cookiecutter 2.0+):
   ```bash
   cookiecutter gh:ichabodcole/project-docs-scaffold-template --overwrite-if-exists
   ```

**Recommended approach for existing projects:** Generate in a temporary
location, review the generated files, then selectively copy what you need.
