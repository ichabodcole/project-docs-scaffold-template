# Review and Cleanup Documentation Status

You are tasked with reviewing project documentation to determine implementation status and perform cleanup operations.

**Documentation types to review:** reports, investigations, plans, and proposals in `docs/` directory

**Your workflow:**

1. **Discover documents to review**
   - List all documents in `docs/reports/`, `docs/investigations/`, `docs/plans/`, and `docs/proposals/`
   - Exclude template files (TEMPLATE in filename) and README files
   - Exclude files already in archive folders
   - Present the user with a list of documents found and ask which ones to review (or confirm to review all)

2. **For each document, perform detective work**
   - **Read the document** to understand:
     - What was the goal/objective?
     - What features or changes were proposed/planned/investigated?
     - Are there specific file paths, components, or features mentioned?
     - What was the expected outcome or deliverables?

   - **Check implementation status** by:
     - Searching the codebase for mentioned files, components, or features
     - Looking for code that implements the described functionality
     - Checking git history for related commits (use `git log --grep` with relevant keywords)
     - Scanning `docs/sessions/` for session notes that might reference this work
     - Cross-referencing with other related documents

   - **Determine status** based on findings:
     - **Completed/Implemented**: Code exists, features work, objectives achieved
     - **Partially Completed**: Some aspects implemented, others not
     - **Not Started**: No evidence of implementation in codebase
     - **Abandoned/Obsolete**: Superseded by other work or no longer relevant

3. **Update document status**
   - Look for a status field or section in the document
   - If found, update it to reflect current status
   - If not found, add a status section at the top of the document (after title/front matter):

     ```markdown
     **Status:** [Completed/Partially Completed/Not Started/Abandoned] (as of YYYY-MM-DD)
     ```

   - For partial completion, add notes about what's done and what remains
   - Add implementation references (file paths, commit SHAs, related sessions) if applicable

4. **Archive completed documents**
   - For documents marked as **Completed** or **Abandoned**:
     - Move the document to the `archive/` subdirectory within its type folder
     - Example: `docs/plans/feature-plan.md` → `docs/plans/archive/feature-plan.md`
     - Use `git mv` command to preserve history
   - For **Partially Completed** or **Not Started**:
     - Leave in the main folder (active work area)

5. **Generate documentation status report**

   Create a report document in `docs/reports/` using the current date:

   - Filename: `YYYY-MM-DD-doc-status-report.md`
   - Use the report template from `docs/reports/YYYY-MM-DD-TEMPLATE-report.md`
   - Report Type: "Doc Status"
   - Generated By: "review-docs command"

   Structure the report with these sections:

   **Executive Summary:**
   - High-level findings (X completed, Y partially done, Z not started)
   - Top recommendations (archive completed, prioritize not started, etc.)
   - Overall assessment of documentation health

   **Scope:**
   - Which document types were reviewed (reports, investigations, plans, proposals)
   - Date range or specific documents reviewed

   **Findings - Categorized by Status:**

   **Completed & Archived:**
   - [Document name] - archived to [path]
     - Summary: [brief description of what was implemented]
     - Evidence: [key files/commits found]

   **Partially Completed:**
   - [Document name] - [XX%] complete
     - Done: [what's implemented]
     - Remaining: [what's not done]
     - Evidence: [relevant code/commits]

   **Not Started:**
   - [Document name]
     - Reason if apparent: [e.g., de-prioritized, blocked, etc.]

   **Abandoned/Obsolete:**
   - [Document name] - archived to [path]
     - Reason: [why it's no longer relevant]

   **Needs Attention:**
   - [Documents that require clarification or decision]

   **Summary Statistics:**
   - Total documents reviewed: X
   - Completed: X (archived)
   - Partially completed: X (remain active)
   - Not started: X (remain active)
   - Abandoned: X (archived)

   **Recommendations:**
   - Prioritize completion of partially-completed docs
   - Archive or update stale documents
   - Consider creating investigations for not-started proposals
   - Any patterns or trends observed

   **Follow-up Actions:**
   - [ ] Review not-started proposals for relevance
   - [ ] Create investigations for uncertain items
   - [ ] Update architecture docs based on completed work
   - [Any other specific actions needed]

6. **Present summary to user**

   After creating the report, present a brief summary to the user:
   - Path to generated report
   - Key findings and statistics
   - Recommend they review the full report in `docs/reports/`

**Important notes:**

- Be thorough in your investigation - check multiple sources of truth
- When in doubt about implementation status, mark as "Partially Completed" and note uncertainty
- Preserve document content - only update status sections
- If a document has no clear objective or is poorly written, note this in your summary
- Use git commands carefully to preserve document history during moves

**Example investigation process:**

For a plan titled "Implement dark mode toggle":

1. Search for "dark mode", "theme", or "toggle" in codebase
2. Look for theme-related components, context providers, or CSS variables
3. Check recent commits for theme-related changes
4. Scan session docs for dark mode implementation notes
5. Test if dark mode actually works (if running project is feasible)
6. Make determination and update document accordingly
