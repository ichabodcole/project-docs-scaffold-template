<!--
USAGE: Copy this file and rename to YYYY-MM-DD-short-description.md

Keep it brief. A backlog item should be quick to write and quick to act on.
Include acceptance criteria only if the "done" state isn't obvious.
Include references if you know the relevant files - it saves discovery time.

When completed, move the file to backlog/_archive/.
