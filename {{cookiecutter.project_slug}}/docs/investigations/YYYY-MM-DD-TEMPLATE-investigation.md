<!--
IMPORTANT: If you haven't read the README.md in this directory, please read it first for context on when to
create investigations and when NOT to create them.

USING THIS TEMPLATE:

This template provides scaffolding to help structure your investigation - it's not a mandatory form.
Use sections that help you communicate findings clearly. Adapt, merge, skip, or add sections as needed.
The goal is to answer your question with clear evidence, not to fill in every blank.

Focus on: What did you investigate? What did you find? What should happen next?

# Investigation: [Topic/Question]

**Date Started:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Investigator:** [Name or "Claude Code"]
**Status:** Active | Concluded
**Outcome:** [TBD | Project created → projects/project-name/ | No Action Needed | Needs More Research | Monitoring]

---

## Question / Motivation

What are we investigating and why? What prompted this? What decision needs to be made?

## Current State Analysis

What does the code/system look like today? Include relevant code references, metrics, patterns, or pain points.

## Investigation Findings

What did we discover through analysis?

### Evidence Gathered

[Code patterns, performance measurements, technology evaluations, concrete examples]

### Key Observations

[What works well? What are the pain points? What patterns emerged?]

### Options Considered

[If action might be needed, what are potential approaches? Include tradeoffs and complexity estimates. Don't forget "Do Nothing" as an option.]

## Recommendation

Based on findings, what should we do? (Check one and explain)

- [ ] **Create Project** - Action is warranted; create a project folder with a proposal
- [ ] **No Action Needed** - Current state is acceptable
- [ ] **Monitor** - Watch for specific signals/thresholds
- [ ] **More Research Needed** - Outstanding questions remain

**Rationale:** [Why this recommendation? What's the key deciding factor?]

## Next Steps

[Concrete actions based on recommendation - create project folder with proposal, document decision, schedule follow-up, etc.]

## Open Questions (Optional)

[Anything that remains unclear or needs further discussion]
