# Documentation

This directory contains project documentation organized into focused subdirectories. Each subdirectory serves a specific purpose in capturing knowledge throughout the development lifecycle.

## Structure

### `/sessions`
Chronological records of focused work sessions (upgrades, bug hunts, refactors, feature development). Sessions provide a concise log of what was done, what was learned, and what's next. Use these to resume work or audit changes without reading commits.

### `/plans`
Development plans that translate proposals into actionable paths forward. Plans outline the _how_ with phased guidance, constraints, and acceptance criteria. They bridge the gap between vision and execution.

### `/proposals`
Feature proposals and design ideas that capture the _why_ and _what_ before implementation begins. Proposals explore options, constraints, and expected outcomes.

### `/playbooks`
Reusable implementation guides for recurring types of work (migrations, refactors, integrations). Playbooks codify proven approaches, including phases, pitfalls, and validation steps.

### `/architecture`
Architecture documentation, design decisions, system diagrams, and technical specifications. Use this for high-level system design and architectural patterns.

### `/lessons-learned`
Specific problems encountered during development and their solutions. Each lesson captures symptoms, environment, behavior, and fix patterns to avoid repeating mistakes.

## Usage

Each subdirectory contains its own README with detailed guidance on:
- When to create documents
- File naming conventions
- Recommended structure
- Tips and best practices

Refer to the subdirectory READMEs for specific instructions on creating and maintaining documentation in each category.
