<!--
IMPORTANT: If you haven't read the README.md in this directory, please read it first for context on when to
create interaction design docs and what to include.

USING THIS TEMPLATE:

Interaction design docs explain how users interact with features - the journey, decision points, and why.
Focus on what users experience and the design thinking behind it.

Think: "What does the user do in this flow and why is it designed this way?"
Not: "Exact specifications for every UI element"

Use sections that help explain the user experience. Skip sections that don't add value.
If your doc feels exhausting to read, you've gone too deep - focus on the journey and rationale.
