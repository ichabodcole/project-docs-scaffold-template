# Project Summary Command

You are tasked with generating a comprehensive, accurate project summary by analyzing the codebase and documentation.

**Your workflow:**

1. **Check for existing summary**
   - Look for existing `docs/PROJECT-SUMMARY.md`
   - If found, read it to understand the previous state
   - Note: You'll create a fresh analysis, but comparing with the old summary helps identify changes

2. **Analyze project foundation**
   - Read `README.md` (project root and docs folder)
   - Read `package.json` or equivalent (language-specific manifest) to understand:
     - Project name and description
     - Key dependencies and technologies
     - Available scripts and tooling
   - Check for configuration files (tsconfig, vite.config, etc.) to understand tech stack
   - Get file tree structure to understand organization: `find . -type f -not -path '*/node_modules/*' -not -path '*/.git/*' | head -100`

3. **Review documentation state**
   - List all documents in each docs subdirectory:
     - `docs/architecture/` - What systems are documented?
     - `docs/proposals/` - What's been proposed?
     - `docs/plans/` - What's planned?
     - `docs/investigations/` - What's being researched?
     - `docs/playbooks/` - What patterns are codified?
     - `docs/lessons-learned/` - What problems were solved?
     - `docs/reports/` - What assessments exist?
   - Read key architecture documents to understand system design
   - Identify which proposals/plans are in active vs archive folders

4. **Understand recent activity and current state**
   - Check `docs/sessions/` for recent session notes (read 3-5 most recent)
   - Use git to find recently modified files: `git log --since="30 days ago" --name-only --pretty=format: | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head -20`
   - Look at recent commits for context: `git log --since="30 days ago" --oneline --no-merges | head -20`
   - Identify active work areas based on recent changes

5. **Inspect key code structure (balanced approach)**
   - Identify main entry points (src/main, src/index, app.py, etc.)
   - Review key directories: `ls -la src/` or equivalent
   - Look for major patterns:
     - Component/module organization
     - Data layer (models, stores, database)
     - API/service layer
     - UI/presentation layer (if applicable)
   - **Don't** read every file - use directory structure and naming to infer organization

6. **Synthesize understanding**

   Based on your analysis, understand:
   - **What is this project?** (core purpose, not just stated purpose)
   - **What problem does it solve?**
   - **What technologies does it use?**
   - **How is it structured?**
   - **What's the current state?** (early development, mature, maintenance, etc.)
   - **What's been happening recently?** (last 30 days)
   - **What direction is it heading?** (based on proposals, plans, recent work)

7. **Create discovery report first**

   Create `docs/reports/YYYY-MM-DD-project-summary-report.md` documenting your investigative process and findings.

   Use this structure:

   ```markdown
   # Project Summary Report

   **Report Date:** YYYY-MM-DD

   *This summary was generated by analyzing the codebase, documentation, and recent activity. It represents the actual state of the project as discovered, not just stated intentions.*
   ```

9. **Present results to user**

   After creating both files, tell the user:
   - **Summary:** Saved to `docs/PROJECT-SUMMARY.md` (polished end product)
   - **Report:** Saved to `docs/reports/YYYY-MM-DD-project-summary-report.md` (discovery notes and findings)
   - Brief executive summary of what the project is (2-3 sentences)
   - If this was an update, mention 2-3 key changes from previous summary
   - Remind them they can review the discovery report to see how you arrived at your conclusions

**Important notes:**

- Focus on **discovery** - what the project actually is based on evidence
- Be accurate over optimistic - describe what exists, not what's intended
- The summary should be useful to both humans (onboarding) and AI agents (context)
- Avoid just restating the README - add value through synthesis
- Keep it concise - aim for ~2 pages, not exhaustive
- Reference specific docs for deeper dives

**Quality checks:**

Before completing, ask yourself:
- ✅ Could someone understand this project from the summary alone?
- ✅ Does it accurately reflect the current state (not just initial vision)?
- ✅ Are recent activities and direction clear?
- ✅ Would this help an AI agent understand the project context?
- ✅ Are key technologies and structure documented?
